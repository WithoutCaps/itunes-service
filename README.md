## Extras
- Jar path: `ItunesApi/api/build/libs/api-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`
- Tests report: `ItunesApi/api/build/reports/pitest/index.html`

## Modules
1. `dtos` - separate jar with DTO's for other services to consume
2. `api` - service itself
## Caching
### Search cache
If query exists in cache - it uses it, calls API otherwise and caches its results in Redis for 24h.

### Top 5 Albums
If album exists in cache - it uses it, calls API otherwise and caches it in Redis indefinitely. 
All existing albums in cache are updated every midnight (in bulk, as Single query)

## Scaling
This application efficiently caches ITunes api results which allows our end users to execute more then 100 queries per hour.
But 100 queries limitation still exists, here are my proposed workarounds:
1. Host multiple reverse proxies on different networks (possibly use something along the lines of AWS lambda for that?)
2. On the internet there are bunch of free proxies, these proxies can be used to route our requests through since we are not sending any sensitive information.

## Technologies used
- Spring Boot
- WebFlux - Because that's the future of Spring
- Redis - For Itunes related data caching
- r2dbc - For users persistence
- PiTest - Because I am a huge fan of mutational testing
- Lombok - Because I am a special little snowflake
- Swagger - To make this homework reviewers life easier :)

## Commands
- `./gradlew bootRun` - to start the application (Note: external Redis instance is required)
- `./gradlew test` - to execute tests
- `./gradlew pitest` - to execute mutational tests (Takes couple minutes to complete)

## Rest endpoints
